Guided breathing and meditation single-page web application that utilizes Spotify's Web Playback SDK and Connect.

Currently:
- A user can play, pause, skip previous, and skip music using Spotify Connect from another device
- A user can see a display of the currently playing track
- A user can control (play, pause, skip) music from the application


Future:
- A user will be able to search Spotify tracks and play directly from the application without another device/Spotify Connect (using Spotify Search endpoint)
- A user will see animations on screen to display prompts with directions for the 4-7-8 breathing technique
- A Web Audio API Audio Context will be added along with a Media Stream Audio Source Node so that playback sounds can be layered
