Project by Anastasia Garelli

This is an app which utilizes the Spotify Web Playback SDK API and the Web Audio API to create a meditation application. It was built with create-react-app.

Currently:
- A user can play, pause, skip previous, and skip music using Spotify Connect from another device
- A user can see a display of the currently playing track

Future:
- A user will be able to control (play, pause, skip) music from the application
- A user will be able to search Spotify tracks to play via the application without another device/Spotify Connect
- A user will be see animations on screen to display prompts with directions for the 4-7-8 breathing technique
